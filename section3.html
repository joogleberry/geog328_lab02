        An interesting fact about monkeys is that they are highly social animals and often live in groups called troops. These troops can range from a few individuals to several hundred members, depending on the species. Living in groups provides monkeys with protection against predators, helps in finding food, and allows for social interactions that are crucial for their well-being.

        Monkeys communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language. For example, they may use specific calls to warn others of danger, signal their location, or express emotions such as excitement or aggression.
